### Building a Developer Community

Building a developer community from scratch is dependent on the product and how to do it adds value to developers life.

I'd be providing insights about how to build a community

Before building a community one must understand the:

- Mission and Vision of the company.

- The product: Utility, Value and Joy.

> True community building takes time, effort and care though there's no point starting this work unless it helps meet strategic goals

### Building a strategy:

- Understand and highlight the goals of your product/company.

* How does the community align with the goals of the product/company.
* If you launch work to routine your community, who in your company or group will need time to do this work well
* If your community are important external stakeholders, who are the internal versions?

### Strategy:

To create a strategy for communities differs to the kind of product you're building the community around.
