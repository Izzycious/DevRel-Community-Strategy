# DevRel-Community-Strategy

Developer Relations, or "DevRel" for short, is a field within the technology industry that focuses on building and maintaining relationships between a company and its developer community. This can include activities such as creating developer-facing documentation and tutorials, providing support and assistance to developers who are using the company's products or services, and building relationships with third-party developers who are creating integrations with the company's offerings. The goal of DevRel is to create a positive and productive relationship between the company and its developer community, which can help to drive adoption of the company's products or services and foster a sense of community and engagement among developers who are building on top of them.
